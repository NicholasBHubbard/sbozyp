# SBOZYP

sbozyp is a package manager for Slackware's [SlackBuilds.org](https://slackbuilds.org/).

# DISCLAIMER

sbozyp is currently in development and is not yet ready for production use.

# WHY SBOZYP EXISTS

[sbopkg](https://sbopkg.org/) is the most popular SlackBuilds.org package manager. However, there are a few things about sbopkg that annoy me, most importantly that its lack of dependency resolution leads to difficult package upgrades, and that it is designed to be used from a TUI instead of CLI. [sbotools](https://pink-mist.github.io/sbotools/) solves these problems, however it is no-longer being maintained. I also do not like that sbotools functionality is split up into different scripts that in-turn import from common libraries. Sbozyp is a single, zero-dependency Perl script.
