# SBOZYP (STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND NOT READY FOR USE)

sbozyp is a package manager for Slackware's [SlackBuilds.org](https://slackbuilds.org/). I created sbozyp because I wanted to and do not claim it is better or worse than its alternatives.

# FEATURES

* Drop-in replacement for sbopkg
* Built in dependency resolution
* Multiple repo support
* Pure CLI user interface (no ncurses)
* Provides package browsing and searching
* Requires zero dependencies (implemented as a single Perl script)
* Supports Slackware 15.0 and greater

# INSTALLATION

TODO
