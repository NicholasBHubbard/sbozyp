This is a mock package to be used in sbozyp test code.

This package specifies thre download urls in the DOWNLOAD field
of its .info file. These values are split up on multiple lines
with newline escapes. It is important to note that the three urls
(and md5's) are the same, so this mock package should probably
only be used in testing the creation of a pkg data structure,
and not actually be built/installed.
