This is a mock package to be used in sbozyp test code.

This package specifies two download urls in the DOWNLOAD field
of its .info file. It is important to note that the two urls
(and md5's) are the same, so this mock package should probably
only be used in testing the creation of a pkg data structure,
and not actually be built/installed.
