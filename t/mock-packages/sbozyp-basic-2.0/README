This is a mock package to be used in sbozyp test code.

This is version 2.0 of sbozyp-basic. It is important to note
that this package is not valid, as its PRGNAM is still sbozyp-basic.
It is also important to know that this package installs the exact
same (fake) software as sbozyp-basic. This mock package is used to
test sbozyps package upgrading capabilities.
